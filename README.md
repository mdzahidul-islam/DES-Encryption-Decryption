Project Phase-I: DES encryption/decryption algorithm with two working modes - ECB and CBC.

1. Save all the files in one directory.

2. Run my_example.py

3. Input the working modes. Either "ECB" or "CBC".

4. Input file type as instruction prompt. Either "str" or "file".

5. If you give "str", then input your message to be encrypted.The program will show both encrypt and decrypt message.

6. If you give "file", wait for a few seconds. The program will encrypt and decrpyt test.png file and save the encrypted/decrypted file.

7. Rerun for multiple test in the same way.

8. The key and IV are given as an example. It can be changed to the user's own key.
